# Project Title

## Description
A brief description of the project.

# Permission and Group Setup in Django

## Custom Permissions
We added four custom permissions to the `Book` model in the `bookshelf` app:
- `can_view`: Allows users to view books.
- `can_create`: Allows users to create new books.
- `can_edit`: Allows users to edit existing books.
- `can_delete`: Allows users to delete books.

These permissions are defined in the `Meta` class of the `Book` model.

## Groups and Permissions
We created three groups with the following permissions:
- **Viewers**: Assigned the `can_view` permission.
- **Editors**: Assigned the `can_create` and `can_edit` permissions.
- **Admins**: Assigned all permissions (`can_view`, `can_create`, `can_edit`, `can_delete`).

## Views and Permissions
In the views, we use the `@permission_required` decorator to enforce these permissions:
- View book: `@permission_required('bookshelf.can_view')`
- Create book: `@permission_required('bookshelf.can_create')`
- Edit book: `@permission_required('bookshelf.can_edit')`
- Delete book: `@permission_required('bookshelf.can_delete')`

## Testing
Test the permissions by logging in as users in different groups and verifying that the permissions are correctly enforced.

## Example Setup:
1. Create and assign groups through the Django admin interface.
2. Test user access based on their group and assigned permissions.


## Security Measures Implemented

- **CSRF Protection**: All forms include `{% csrf_token %}` to prevent CSRF attacks.
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: All database queries use Django's ORM, preventing SQL injection.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: CSP headers are set to limit the sources from which content can be loaded.
- **HTTPS-Only Cookies**: `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` and `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` are set to `True` to ensure cookies are sent only over HTTPS.
- **Security Headers**: The app uses security headers like `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER`, `X_FRAME_OPTIONS`, and `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF`.


# Deployment Configuration for HTTPS

## Web Server Setup

### 1. Nginx Configuration
To enable HTTPS with Nginx:
- Install an SSL certificate (e.g., via Let's Encrypt or a commercial certificate provider).
- Configure the Nginx server block as follows:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;  # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/yourdomain.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/yourdomain.key;

    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:...';

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}

### 2. **Security Review Documentation**

**File Name**: `SECURITY_REVIEW.md`  
Place this file in the root directory to summarize the security measures implemented in your Django project.

#### Example `SECURITY_REVIEW.md`

```markdown
# Security Review for LibraryProject

This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect the application and ensure secure communication.

## 1. HTTPS Enforcement
- **`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`**: Enabled to ensure all HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS.
- **HSTS Settings**:
  - `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`: Set to `31536000` (1 year) to enforce HTTPS.
  - `SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS`: Enabled to include all subdomains.
  - `SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD`: Enabled for HSTS preload list inclusion.

## 2. Secure Cookies
- **`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`**: Ensures session cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
- **`CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`**: Ensures CSRF cookies are only sent over HTTPS.

## 3. Security Headers
- **`X_FRAME_OPTIONS`**: Set to `DENY` to prevent clickjacking.
- **`SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF`**: Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing a response.
- **`SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER`**: Enabled to protect against XSS attacks.

## 4. CSRF Protection
- All forms include `{% csrf_token %}` to ensure CSRF tokens are used for protection.

## 5. Input Validation
- Django ORM is used for database queries, preventing SQL injection.
- User inputs are validated using Django forms with proper sanitization.

## 6. Deployment Configuration
- SSL certificates configured for HTTPS via Nginx or Apache.
- Application runs in production mode with `DEBUG=False`.

## 7. Potential Areas for Improvement
- Implement rate-limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to control external resource loading.

## Conclusion
The application follows best practices for securing communication and preventing common vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection. The configurations should be tested periodically to ensure continued compliance with security standards.
